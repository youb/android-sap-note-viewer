SAP Support Note Viewer for Android allows you to have easy access to SAP support notes from your mobile phone.

It provides the following functionality:
  * View note based on note number
  * Store a reference to favorite notes
  * Store SAP Service Username and password so you do not have to login

What’s new in version 1.20:
  * Scrolling problem fixed by modifying SAP HTML code on the fly
  * After adding a  note to favorites, it should include the note’s title in the favorites list(will not function for existing favorites. Delete and re-add them)
  * You can now share a note by either long-clicking on it in the list or selecting it from the menu when in view mode This will allow you to easily share the link through e-mail, twitter or any other android app which support generic text SEND intents
  * And the coolest one :)
> Integration with Chrome to Phone as seen on Google I/O a few days ago. This allows you to click a button in your Google Chrome browser  on the PC, and have it sent directly to the SAP Support Note Viewer app on Android a few seconds later
(first install chrome to phone extension and android app from http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/ and make sure it works. Then navigate to an SAP note in service market place on your computer and click the icon)

It requires that you have an SAP Service User (S-user). If you do not have this user, there is no point of downloading the application.
